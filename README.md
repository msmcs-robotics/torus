### This project is temporarily depreciated. 
A new system to replace the old function of Torus is currently in development. 
Torus is based on kubernetes, the new system instead looks to capitalize on the use of Pytorch's integrated Distributed Data Paralell functionality.
While not planned for use in the near future, the automated deployments and monitoring within a kubernetes cluster could prove valuable for other projects.
